## Webpage: The Whole Church
A simple, responsive webpage with a header, subheader, and interactive accordion components.
Built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Also used heroicons (https://heroicons.com/).

## Setup Instructions:
- Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/jasoncheng20/intouch-assessment.git
- Open the index.html file in your browser

## Notes/Decisions:
This was pretty straigthforward, I just tried to mimic the original design.
I tried to make the Accordion sections like a component, tried to use semantic HTML as much as possible, as well as some accessibility labels (i.e. aria labels).
